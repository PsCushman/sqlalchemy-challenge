# sqlalchemy-challenge

This challeneg is seperated into two sections. The analysis is in a jupyter notebook called "cilimate_starter.ipynb" and the api app in "app.py". 

I asked a LA for help with formating datetime to do calculations. 

Since we haven't learned any html yet, I did a little of my own research and got help from chatgpt to help create a framework for the homepage. I then tinkered with it to format it and add directions. The very simple code as I orginally wrote it, is commented out above the generated and researched code for the homepage. The rest of the code is mine.
