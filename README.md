# sqlalchemy-challenge

This challenge is seperated into two sections. The analysis is in a jupyter notebook called "cilimate_starter.ipynb" and the api app in "app.py". 

I asked a LA for help with formating datetime to do calculations. My tutor and I went over date/time formating as well. We also spoke about a lot of little aspects to clean up my code.  

Since we haven't learned any css yet, I did a little of my own research and got help from chatgpt to help create a framework for the homepage. I then tinkered with it to add a fun font header and directions. The very simple code as I orginally wrote it, is commented out above the generated and researched code for the homepage. The rest of the code is mine. I spoke with my turor about not going too far, but I felt directions were helpful.
